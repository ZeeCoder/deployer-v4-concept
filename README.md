goals:
- Code over configuration!
- Familiar, but comprehensive API
- no globals
- reusable tasks
- code "discoverability"
- multiple server prototypes?

todo:
- collect all the current issues and features, which the new implementation
should also support

issues to solve:
- server name / stage problem

    instead, let's introduce server groups and server stages as different
    things

- default server, default stage, default group on deployment
- server names -> are they really necessary?

notes:
    - Configuration -> Auth
    - Environment -> Configuration
